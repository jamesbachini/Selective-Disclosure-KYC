# Project Summary: Selective Disclosure KYC Demo

## Overview

This project implements a **privacy-preserving KYC (Know Your Customer) system** using **BLS ring signatures** and **Soroban smart contracts** on the Stellar blockchain. The system allows users to prove they possess certain verified attributes (like being over 18 or being a UK resident) without revealing their identity or full credentials.

## Key Innovation

Traditional KYC systems require users to reveal their full identity every time they need to prove an attribute. This system uses **ring signatures** to enable **anonymous proof**: a user can prove they belong to a group of verified individuals without revealing which specific member they are.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Smart Contract (Soroban/Rust)
**Location:** `/contracts/ring-sig-kyc/src/lib.rs`

**Key Features:**
- Admin management and issuer registration
- Attribute-based ring creation and storage
- BLS12-381 ring signature verification
- Anonymous verification tracking (login count)

**Core Functions:**
- `initialize()` - Set up contract with admin address
- `register_issuer()` - Admin registers trusted KYC providers
- `create_ring_for_attribute()` - Issuer creates user groups per attribute
- `verify_attribute()` - Verify ring signature without revealing signer
- `get_login_count()` - Track total successful verifications

### 2. Backend Server (Node.js/Express)
**Location:** `/backend/src/server.js`

**Purpose:**
- Relay KYC requests between users and issuers
- Temporary in-memory storage (no persistent database)
- Facilitate credential issuance workflow

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/request-kyc` - User submits KYC request
- `GET /api/kyc-requests` - Issuer retrieves pending requests
- `POST /api/approve-kyc` - Issuer approves and creates credential
- `GET /api/credential/:userId` - User retrieves issued credential
- `GET /api/stats` - System statistics

### 3. Frontend (React/Vite/Tailwind)
**Location:** `/frontend/src/`

**Pages:**

1. **Home Page** (`/`)
   - Landing page with feature overview
   - Navigation to all flows

2. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`)
   - Connect Freighter wallet
   - Initialize contract
   - Register trusted KYC issuers
   - View registered issuers

3. **Issuer Dashboard** (`/issuer`)
   - Connect Freighter wallet
   - View pending KYC requests
   - Approve/reject users
   - Auto-generate keys and create rings

4. **Verification Page** (`/verify`)
   - Select KYC provider
   - Choose attributes to verify
   - Submit mock KYC information
   - Wait for approval

5. **Confirmation Page** (`/confirm`)
   - Load stored credentials
   - Select attribute to prove
   - Generate challenge
   - Sign with ring signature
   - Verify on-chain anonymously

### 4. Utilities

**Credentials Management** (`/frontend/src/utils/credentials.js`)
- AES-GCM encryption/decryption
- localStorage management
- Credential formatting
- User ID generation

**Contract Interaction** (`/frontend/src/utils/contract.js`)
- Freighter wallet integration
- Soroban contract bindings
- Transaction building and signing
- Ring signature operations

## Data Flow

```
1. Admin → Contract: Register issuer public keys

2. User → Backend: Submit KYC request with attributes
   Backend: Store temporarily

3. Issuer → Backend: Retrieve pending requests
   Issuer → Contract: Generate keys, create attribute rings
   Issuer → Backend: Send credential JSON
   Backend → User: One-time credential retrieval

4. User: Store credential in localStorage (encrypted)

5. User → Contract: Generate challenge, sign with ring signature
   Contract: Verify signature against attribute ring
   Contract: Increment login count (if valid)
   User: Receive verification result without identity reveal
```

## Credential Structure

```json
{
  "issuer": "0xabc123...",
  "user_keys": {
    "over_18": "0xPRIVATEKEY_HEX",
    "resident_uk": "0xPRIVATEKEY_HEX"
  },
  "rings": {
    "over_18": ["0xPUBKEY1", "0xPUBKEY2", "0xPUBKEY3", ...],
    "resident_uk": ["0xPUBKEY4", "0xPUBKEY5", ...]
  },
  "issued_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Each credential contains:
- **issuer**: BLS public key of issuing authority
- **user_keys**: Private keys for each verified attribute
- **rings**: Full ring of public keys for anonymity set
- **issued_at**: Timestamp of credential issuance

## Cryptographic Operations

### Ring Signature Generation
1. User has private key `sk` for attribute
2. User's public key `pk` is in ring `[pk1, pk2, pk3, ...]`
3. To prove attribute without revealing which key:
   - Generate random nonce
   - Create challenge hash
   - Compute responses for each ring member
   - Only user's response uses their private key
   - Others are random values linked by challenge chain

### Verification
1. Contract receives message, signature, and attribute name
2. Loads ring for that attribute
3. Verifies signature against entire ring
4. Returns `true` if ANY member could have signed
5. Doesn't reveal WHICH member signed

## Privacy Guarantees

1. **Anonymity**: Verifier learns user has attribute, not which specific user
2. **Unlinkability**: Multiple proofs can't be linked to same user
3. **Selective Disclosure**: User chooses which attributes to prove
4. **No On-Chain PII**: No personal data stored on blockchain
5. **Local Control**: User manages credentials in browser

## Supported Attributes (Extensible)

- `over_18` - Age 18+
- `over_21` - Age 21+
- `resident_uk` - UK residency
- `resident_us` - US residency
- `no_criminal_history` - Background check
- `accredited_investor` - Investment qualification

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Smart contract tests in Rust
- Test key generation, signing, verification
- Test admin and issuer functions

### Integration Tests
- Full user flow from KYC submission to verification
- Backend API endpoint testing
- Frontend component testing

### Manual Testing
1. Admin registers issuer
2. User submits KYC request
3. Issuer approves and issues credential
4. User proves attribute with ring signature
5. Verify login count increments

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- Ring signature anonymity
- Local credential storage
- Challenge-response for replay protection
- Admin-only issuer registration
- Encrypted credential option

### Future Enhancements
- Credential expiration
- Revocation mechanism
- Multi-signature admin control
- Rate limiting
- Formal security audit

## Performance Metrics

- **Contract Size**: ~50KB WASM
- **Ring Verification**: O(n) where n = ring size
- **Typical Ring Size**: 5-10 members
- **Backend Response Time**: <100ms
- **Frontend Load Time**: <2s

## Use Cases

1. **Age Verification**: Prove age without showing ID
2. **KYC for DeFi**: Access financial services privately
3. **Credential-Based Access**: Prove qualifications anonymously
4. **Voting Systems**: Eligible voter proof without identity
5. **Anonymous Authentication**: Login without revealing user

## Limitations

### Current
- Demo-grade cryptography (simplified)
- No credential revocation
- No expiration dates
- Mock KYC process (no real document verification)
- In-memory backend (data lost on restart)

### Planned
- Production-grade BLS implementation
- Revocation lists
- Time-bound credentials
- Real document verification (OCR, liveness)
- Persistent database

## Future Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Demo implementation
- Basic ring signatures
- Mock KYC flow
- UI/UX for all roles

**Phase 2**: Security hardening
- Formal cryptography audit
- Production key generation
- Revocation mechanism
- Expiration support

**Phase 3**: Feature expansion
- Document verification
- Video KYC
- Mobile app
- Cross-chain support

**Phase 4**: Production deployment
- Mainnet deployment
- Real issuer integration
- Compliance features
- Performance optimization

## Key Learnings

1. **Ring Signatures**: Enable true anonymity within a group
2. **BLS12-381**: Efficient curve for pairing-based crypto
3. **Soroban**: Powerful smart contract platform on Stellar
4. **Selective Disclosure**: Users control what they reveal
5. **Local-First**: Keep sensitive data off-chain
